# ROLLER
![Roller logo](./images/whiplash.gif)

This project aims to implement all the functionality of the 1995 game Whiplash/Fatal Racing in a way that builds and runs on modern PCs. Where necessary, DOS-specific functions are substituted with SDL and Windows/Unix equivalents.

## About

Debug symbol dump generated with wdump, part of: https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2

Useful tool in generating nice asm output with symbols from wdump applied: https://github.com/fonic/wcdatool

Directions on how to use wcdatool and get remote debugging working with open watcom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG9tEZOSrQg

Note: wdump symbol offsets do not account for DOS4GW.EXE. Load FATAL.EXE_split_dos4g_payload.exe (FATAL.EXE with DOS4GW.EXE split off, generated by wcdatool) into Ida/Ghidra to have matching symbol offsets.

## External Dependencies Used:
* SDL3.2.14: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
* SDL_Image3.2.4: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image
* WildMIDI 0.4.6: https://github.com/Mindwerks/wildmidi

## Installation

Assets from a retail copy of the game are required to run. Drop the contents of the build directory (bin or zig-out) into the Whiplash/Fatal Racing install directory. ROLLER.exe should be in the same directory as WHIP.EXE/FATAL.EXE.
