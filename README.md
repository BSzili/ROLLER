Mostly pseudocode that doesn't build, some functions and data decompiled.

Debug symbol dump generated with https://github.com/fonic/wcdatool

Directions on how to use wcdatool and get remote debugging working with open watcom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG9tEZOSrQg

Note: When applying symbols generated by wcdatool to a FATAL.EXE decomp in Ida or Ghidra you must either account for the offset caused by DOS4GW or instead run Ida/Ghidra on "FATAL.EXE_split_dos4g_payload.exe" which is an exe generated by wcdatool without DOS4GW. To run FATAL.EXE_split_dos4g_payload.exe for debugging, DOS4GW.EXE must be in the same directory.
