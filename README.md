### About

C skeleton that builds, some functions and data decompiled.

Debug symbol dump generated with wdump, part of: https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2

Useful tool in generating nice asm output with symbols from wdump applied: https://github.com/fonic/wcdatool

Directions on how to use wcdatool and get remote debugging working with open watcom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG9tEZOSrQg

Note: wdump symbol offsets do not account for DOS4GW.EXE. Load FATAL.EXE_split_dos4g_payload.exe (FATAL.EXE with DOS4GW.EXE split off, generated by wcdatool) into Ida/Ghidra to have matching symbol offsets.
